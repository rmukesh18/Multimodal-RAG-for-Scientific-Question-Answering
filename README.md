# Multimodal RAG System for Scientific Question Answering

This project answers complex scientific questions using information from **text, tables, and images** in research papers. 
It combines the capabilities of **LLaMA3**, **LLaVA**, **LangChain**, and **ChromaDB** to deliver accurate, context-aware results.

## Features

- **Multimodal Parsing:** Extracts and embeds text, tables, and images from scientific documents.
- **Vector Storage:** Uses ChromaDB for efficient retrieval across all content types.
- **Advanced Reasoning:** Employs LLaMA3 (language) and LLaVA (vision-language) models for answer generation.
- **Composable Pipeline:** Modular architecture managed with LangChain.
